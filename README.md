Source password: **********

Destination IMAP server: outlook.office365.com
Destination email address: newuser@domain.com
Destination password: **********

Perform dry run? (y/n) [y]: n
Delete source emails after migration? (y/n) [n]: y
Skip folder size calculation? (y/n) [y]: y

## Security Considerations
### 1. Password Security
*  Passwords never stored on disk
*  Immediate memory cleanup post-migration
*  Recommended to run in trusted environments
### 2. Dangerous Operation Protection
*  Source deletion requires explicit confirmation
*  Dry run mode enabled by default
### 3. Two-Factor Authentication Accounts
```plaintext
For 2FA-enabled accounts (e.g., Gmail):
1. Visit https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Generate application-specific password
3. Use this password during input
```
**Important Notice**: Always backup critical data before migration. The author is not responsible for data loss.
